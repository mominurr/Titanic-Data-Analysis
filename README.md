## Project Overview
The Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg on its maiden voyage in 1912. The ship had only 2,224 passengers aboard and lost half of them. The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers aboard the ship including their age, sex, class, fare, etc. The goal of this project is to analyze this dataset and determine the factors that influenced passenger survival.

## Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset includes the following columns:

- **PassengerId**: A unique identifier assigned to each passenger.
- **Survived**: Indicates whether the passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- **Pclass**: Passenger's ticket class, which serves as a proxy for socio-economic status (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
- **Name**: Full name of the passenger.
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger (male or female).
- **Age**: Age of the passenger in years.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic.
- **Parch**: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic.
- **Ticket**: The ticket number assigned to the passenger.
- **Fare**: The fare paid by the passenger for their ticket.
- **Cabin**: The cabin number assigned to the passenger.
- **Embarked**: The port where passengers boarded the Titanic (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing unnecessary columns, and correcting data types.
2. **Data Exploration**: Analyzing the dataset to identify trends and patterns in survival rates based on different factors such as age, gender, and class.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Performing statistical tests to determine the significance of the findings.

## Key Findings
- Children had the highest survival rate compared to adults and seniors.
- Adult females had significantly higher survival rates than adult males, especially in first class.
- The survival rate varied significantly by passenger class, with first-class passengers having the highest rates.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into the factors that influenced survival on the Titanic, highlighting the impact of age, gender, and socio-economic status on passenger survival rates.

## Future Work
Further analysis could include a deeper exploration of the relationships between different variables and the use of machine learning models to predict survival based on passenger characteristics.
